This Project Simulates the biased Random Walk of an atom in a 2 dimensional lattice on Python. The direction of movement of the atom is decided by the biasing probabilitises. 
After running the simualtion, the trajectory of the particle is displayed which is in accordance with the given biasing probabilities. 
Graphs are also plotted for displacement and Mean squared displacement vs time. 
The Simualtion is then run for n trials. The average trajctory of the atom is displayed for all these trials along with average displacement vs time and mean squared displacement vs time plots
