# Random Walk Simulation

This project simulates the biased and unbiased Random Walk of an atom in a 2D and 3D lattices on Python. 

## Sections:

1. Unbiased 1-D Random Walk
2. Unbiased 2-D Random Walk
3. Unbiased 3-D Random Walk
4. Special Case of Random Walk- No. of steps is 5 times the lattics size
5. Biased Random Walk
